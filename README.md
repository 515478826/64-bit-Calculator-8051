# 64-bit-Calculator-8051

64 bit unsigned number calculator implemented over 8051 microprocessor and the UI of this project is the terminal which connects with
controller via UART.
in this code I implement 64 bit integers type using structure as there are no 64 bit integers in keil for 8051
the user input the number in text format to the terminal in form of hexadecimal. 
Then the code checks whether the user enter the data in correct format or not after that it Perform the required operation
based on the user operation .
finally it Echo the result to the terminal.
the Repo contains 
1-simulation files using (proteus) 
2- the source and header files
3-project files using keil ÂµVision V5.12.0.0 
4-the .hex as you can run the code directly without compiling the source files.
